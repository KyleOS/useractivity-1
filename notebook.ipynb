    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "Have you ever think about how hard it is to create a showcase in a way that everybody understands, including non-technical people? Even harder is for a group, such as research groups, or enterprise teams. To overcome this, many groups are now investing in online platforms (such as GitHub, Kaggle, Kyso) to create their private or public __online community__ to __knowledge sharing__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The group (team of users) has __content performance__ and __engagement__ measured by their activities through the number of __posts__, __comments__, and __views__. The providers of such platforms have data, being capable of measuring the same metrics for all teams, and understand their behavior. In this way, I propose here to analyze hundreds of customers with different sizes to discover how their group size impacts on their activities.\n",
